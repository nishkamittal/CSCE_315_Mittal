                        <h3>Residential Database</h3>
                        <h4>For my CS IB Project, I created a Residential Database using Java. I started off with interviewing 
                            my residential area on their input regarding our existing system. Then, I sketched out a plan with designs of
                            what functionalities I would change within the existing system. Following this, I decided to begin the coding part
                            and develop the GUI. The final stages involved testing the product with select groups, and getting their feedback to
                            make changes to the updated system.
                        </h4>
                        <h3>Student Attendance</h3>
                        <h4>For my CSCE 314 class, I created a student attendance application that would track attendance and generate
                            queries, as requested. I used Java, JavaFX and Scenebuilder for this project. This project had a few different moving parts
                            and I had to learn how to use a couple different new software. Eventually though, I was able to develop the project and 
                            submit a video demonstration as well.

                        <h3>Tennis Tracker</h3>
                        <h4>As a massive tennis fan, I would like to create an app that allows you to follow certain players, tracks their
                            match schedule, ranking, and even links to which streaming services you could watch them play. Current systems are a bit 
                            inefficient and out of date, and often require different platforms just to access all the data. I would like to be able to 
                            sync all of that into one so that new users would have a good starting point. 
                        <h3>Cook Book</h3>
                        <h4>Although versions of this already exist, I would like to create a more efficient website that allows you to feed
                            in what ingredients and their quantity that you have lying around at home, and outputs different recipes that could
                            be made from what you have available. As someone who often impulse buys food at the grocery store, and then ends up with
                        random ingredients lying around at home, this website would allow me to up food and even generate new recipe ideas! </h4>
