                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>I am currently a junior computer science student at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">Texas A&M University</a>. 
                            I hope to graduate in May, 2025. I created this website as a part of my CSCE 315 class and learnt a lot more about HTML and css
                            in the process. Although I have never really thought of web development as the main field I would want to work in,
                            after this project, I have gained a lot of transferrable skills and would love to expand further on this!
                            Also, I hope to be able to add this to my resume so that potential recruiters can learn more about me.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Currently, I am the Corporate Outreach Officer for <a href="https://www.awics.org/" target="_blank">AWiCS, Aggie Women in Computer Science.</a> AWiCS has really helped
                            me find a community of Women in Tech that have gone through the same experiences as I have, and thus want to share more with others.
                            Also, I work at the <a href="https://careercenter.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">Career Center</a> at Texas A&M University as a Student Worker. I love working here
                            as I get to interact with recruiters behind the scenes, get professional advice from our advisors and talk to students
                            who want to learn more about jobs!
                            These different opportunities have helped me learn more about the world of Computer Science at the <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">College of Engineering</a>, both academically, as well as professionally. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I chose Computer Science as my major because I really enjoyed all my coding classes in highschool, and moving forward
                            with my career, a lot of the industries that I want to work such as Data Science and Machine Learning require Computer Science knowledge.
                            My ideal job would be within consulting as I would like to be able to work with clients from a multitude of backgrounds. 
                            Also, I would love to relocate as a part of my job so that I can experience different cultures, and I think having a Tech 
                            Consulting job would assist in that. 
                        </p>
